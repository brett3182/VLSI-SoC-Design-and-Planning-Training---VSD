**Flop Ratio** = Number of D Flip Flops / Number of Cells  
= 1613 / 14876  
= 0.1084

Hence, the flop ratio is 10.84% 

## #**Day 2 Labs**

Height = 660.685um, Width = 671.405um 

Area = 660.685um x 671.405um = 0.443mmÂ²

Placement ensures that the standard cells are positioned in their respective rows without any DRC errors; however, since it follows global placement, legality may not be maintained.
